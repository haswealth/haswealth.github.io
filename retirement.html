  <h1>Shariah Retirement Planning</h1>
  <p>Securing your golden years through structured wealth preservation and ethical income generation strategies.</p>
</header>

<section id="challenge">
  <h2>Beyond Saving: The Stewardship of Longevity</h2>
  <p>Retirement planning in the modern age faces two major hurdles: inflation and longevity. For the Muslim family, there is an added layer of responsibility—ensuring that our retirement nest egg remains <strong>Shariah-compliant</strong> and serves as a means of <strong>Barakah</strong> for our legacy.</p>
</section>



<section id="pillars">
  <h2>Our Three Pillars of Retirement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Accumulation Phase:</strong> Utilizing disciplined Unit Trust portfolios and Private Retirement Schemes (PRS) to build a robust foundation during your working years.</li>
    <li><strong>The Preservation Phase:</strong> Transitioning your assets into lower-volatility Shariah-compliant instruments as you approach retirement to protect your capital.</li>
    <li><strong>The Distribution Phase:</strong> Structuring a sustainable monthly "salary" from your investments to maintain your standard of living without exhausting your principal.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="why-structured">
  <h2>Why Structured Advisory?</h2>
  <p>Relying solely on mandatory savings (like EPF/KWSP) may not be sufficient for the lifestyle and legacy goals of many Malaysian families. Our advisory helps you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate your actual "Retirement Gap" based on current inflation trends.</li>
    <li>Incorporate <strong>Hibah</strong> and legacy planning into your retirement structure.</li>
    <li>Optimize tax efficiencies through Shariah-compliant retirement instruments.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="regulatory">
  <h2>Professional Guidance</h2>
  <p>Retirement advisory is a holistic process. <strong>Hairul Anuar Bin Sulaiman</strong> provides these services as an <strong>Appointed Islamic Financial Adviser Representative (IFAR)</strong> of Phillip Wealth Planners Sdn Bhd.</p>
  <p>We believe that retirement is not the end of wealth management, but the beginning of a new chapter in financial stewardship.</p>
