    <h2>Understanding Shariah Principles</h2>
    <p>Shariah-compliant succession respects Islamic inheritance laws and guidelines. By understanding the rules for distribution, families can minimize disputes and align wealth transfer with ethical principles.</p>

    <h2>Structuring Wealth Transfers</h2>
    <p>Use trusts, Takaful instruments, and designated Shariah-compliant investment structures to facilitate transfers. Proper structuring ensures liquidity, minimizes taxes, and safeguards intended beneficiaries.</p>
