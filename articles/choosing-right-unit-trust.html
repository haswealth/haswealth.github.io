    <h1>Choosing the Right Unit Trust Funds: Principles for Shariah Compliance</h1>
    <p><em>Structured guidance to select ethical, Shariah-compliant investment funds for long-term financial stability.</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Selecting the right Shariah-compliant Unit Trust funds is a blend of financial science and ethical integrity. Beyond just chasing the highest returns, investors must evaluate fund objectives, risk profiles, and the quality of Shariah governance to build a resilient and ethical portfolio.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Shariah Screening Process</h2>
    <p>A Shariah-compliant fund does not simply avoid prohibited industries. It undergoes a two-tier screening process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Activity Screening:</strong> Excluding companies involved in conventional finance, gambling, alcohol, pork-related activities, and tobacco.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Ratio Screening:</strong> Analyzing debt-to-equity and interest-income ratios to ensure the company remains within the Shariah-permissible threshold (usually 33%).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>Evaluating Performance and Risk</h2>
    <p>While Shariah compliance is the foundation, financial suitability is the driver. We analyze funds based on <strong>Risk-Adjusted Returns</strong>. It is vital to look at how a fund performs during a market downturn, not just during a boom. Consistency in the fund management team and the stability of the fund house are equally important metrics.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Alignment with Life Goals</h2>
    <p>There is no "perfect" fund, only the "right" fund for your specific timeline. An aggressive equity fund may be appropriate for a newborn's education plan but would be highly inappropriate for a retiree's immediate medical fund. Proper fund selection ensures your portfolio is strategically positioned for your specific stage of life.</p>

    <h3>Start with a Professional Fund Audit</h3>
    <p>Don't select funds based on past performance alone. Let's look at the underlying quality, risk, and compliance of your choices together.</p>
