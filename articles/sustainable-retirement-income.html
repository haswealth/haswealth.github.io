  <section>
    <h2>The Shift from Accumulation to Distribution</h2>
    <p>Creating a sustainable retirement income stream is a distinct challenge from building wealth. Shariah-compliant strategies emphasize structured withdrawals, risk management, and ethical investment choices, providing the <strong>Sakinah</strong> (peace of mind) needed to maintain your desired lifestyle without the fear of outliving your capital.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The "Bucket Strategy" for Shariah Portfolios</h2>
    <p>A reliable income stream often requires dividing your assets into "buckets" based on when you need the money:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate Bucket (0-3 years):</strong> Cash and Shariah Money Market funds for short-term living expenses.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate Bucket (3-7 years):</strong> Income-focused Sukuk funds and stable dividend-paying Unit Trusts.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth Bucket (7+ years):</strong> Shariah Equities to provide the growth needed to combat long-term inflation.</li>
    </ul>
    
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Shariah-Compliant Income Vehicles</h2>
    <p>By utilizing Unit Trusts that focus on high-quality Shariah-compliant dividends and sukuk yields, we can create a "synthetic salary." Diversification across these vehicles enhances stability, ensuring that your income is not overly dependent on a single market sector.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Withdrawal and Risk Management</h2>
    <p>The "sequence of returns" risk—experiencing a market downturn early in retirement—can be devastating. Structured, disciplined withdrawals combined with a Takaful-based safety net protect your principal from early depletion while preserving wealth for your family legacy.</p>

      <strong>Note:</strong> Retirement planning involves long-term assumptions regarding inflation and market returns. Past performance of Shariah-compliant funds is not indicative of future results. Please refer to the Master Prospectus for full risk disclosures.
