    <h2>Introduction: The Necessity of Vigilance</h2>
    <p>Even the most robust Shariah-compliant portfolio is not a "set-and-forget" instrument. Financial markets are dynamic, and over time, asset classes perform differently, leading to a phenomenon known as <strong>Portfolio Drift</strong>. Periodic review is the mechanism of stewardship that ensures your investments stay true to your original intentions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Portfolio Review Matters</h2>
    <p>As certain funds grow faster than others, your risk profile changes. For example, a successful run in Shariah equities might leave you over-exposed to market volatility. Regular reviews allow us to identify these imbalances, assess underperforming funds, and ensure that your portfolio still adheres to the latest Shariah compliance standards.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Rebalancing: The Disciplined Buy-and-Sell</h2>
    <p>Rebalancing is the practice of restoring your intended asset allocation. This often involves taking profits from over-performing assets and reinvesting in under-represented areas. This contrarian, disciplined approach forces us to "buy low and sell high," reinforcing long-term growth while strictly respecting Islamic investment principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Frequency and Best Practices</h2>
    <p>For most families, an annual or semi-annual review is ideal. However, major life events—such as marriage, a new child, or a shift in career—should trigger an immediate reassessment. By combining economic trend monitoring with your personal evolution, we ensure that your capital remains a resilient tool for your legacy.</p>
