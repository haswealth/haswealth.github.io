    <p><em>Maintain disciplined growth and risk management with structured portfolio reviews and rebalancing strategies.</em></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Even the most carefully constructed Shariah-compliant portfolio requires ongoing attention. Periodic review and rebalancing are essential to ensure that investments remain aligned with family goals, risk tolerance, and market developments.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Review Matters</h2>
    <p>Financial markets evolve, and portfolios drift from their intended allocations over time. Regular reviews help identify underperforming funds, exposure imbalances, and opportunities for ethical growth without compromising Shariah compliance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rebalancing Strategies</h2>
    <p>Rebalancing restores the intended allocation by adjusting fund proportions. This disciplined approach reduces concentration risk, reinforces risk management, and maintains long-term growth objectives while respecting Islamic investment principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Frequency and Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Annual or semi-annual reviews are recommended. Monitoring economic trends, compliance updates, and personal circumstances ensures portfolios stay on track. Combining review with informed adjustments preserves both capital and Shariah integrity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Structured review and rebalancing are critical to sustaining disciplined, Shariah-compliant portfolios. <a href="../contact.html">Contact HAS Wealth Advisory</a> to ensure your investments remain aligned with your family’s ethical and financial goals.</p>
