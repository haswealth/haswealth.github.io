    <h1>Periodic Review & Rebalancing: Keeping Your Shariah Portfolio on Track</h1>
    <p><em>Maintain disciplined growth and risk management with structured portfolio reviews and rebalancing strategies.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction: The Necessity of Vigilance</h2>
    <p>Even the most robust Shariah-compliant portfolio is not a "set-and-forget" instrument. Financial markets are dynamic, and over time, asset classes perform differently, leading to a phenomenon known as <strong>Portfolio Drift</strong>. Periodic review is the mechanism of stewardship that ensures your investments stay true to your original intentions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Portfolio Review Matters</h2>
    <p>As certain funds grow faster than others, your risk profile changes. For example, a successful run in Shariah equities might leave you over-exposed to market volatility. Regular reviews allow us to identify these imbalances, assess underperforming funds, and ensure that your portfolio still adheres to the latest Shariah compliance standards.</p>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>Rebalancing: The Disciplined Buy-and-Sell</h2>
    <p>Rebalancing is the practice of restoring your intended asset allocation. This often involves taking profits from over-performing assets and reinvesting in under-represented areas. This contrarian, disciplined approach forces us to "buy low and sell high," reinforcing long-term growth while strictly respecting Islamic investment principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Frequency and Best Practices</h2>
    <p>For most families, an annual or semi-annual review is ideal. However, major life events—such as marriage, a new child, or a shift in career—should trigger an immediate reassessment. By combining economic trend monitoring with your personal evolution, we ensure that your capital remains a resilient tool for your legacy.</p>

      <strong>Note:</strong> Rebalancing involves shifting assets between funds and may be subject to switching fees or tax considerations. Past performance is not an indicator of future results. Please refer to the Product Disclosure Sheet (PDS) for full details.
