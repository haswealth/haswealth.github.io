    <p><em>Best practices for safeguarding family income and assets through disciplined Shariah-compliant stewardship.</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction: The Shield of Stewardship</h2>
    <p>Effective wealth stewardship requires more than a growth mindset; it requires a defensive framework. Shariah-compliant Takaful offers the necessary structure to protect income streams, physical assets, and long-term financial stability. Properly implemented, these strategies ensure that the wealth you build today remains a source of <strong>Barakah</strong> for tomorrow.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Protecting Your Greatest Asset: Human Capital</h2>
    <p>For most families, their primary asset is not their house or bank account—it is their ability to earn an income (Human Capital). Unexpected health events or accidents can disrupt this flow. Takaful acts as a replacement engine, ensuring that essential family obligations are met and the standard of living is preserved even when your primary income is challenged.</p>

    <h2>Asset Protection: Defending Your Harvest</h2>
    <p>Wealth accumulation takes years, but unforeseen risks can deplete it in months. Shariah-compliant Takaful products are structured to protect tangible assets against risks like critical illness expenses or disability, which often force families to liquidate their investments at a loss. By ring-fencing your wealth with protection, you maintain the integrity of your long-term portfolio.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Multi-Generational Safety Net</h2>
    <p>True risk management looks decades ahead. Integrating Takaful with succession tools like <strong>Hibah</strong> ensures that wealth continuity is not disrupted by the complexities of estate settlement. This holistic approach safeguards both current household stability and the financial dignity of future generations.</p>
