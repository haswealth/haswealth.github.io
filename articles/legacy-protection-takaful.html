  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Building a financial legacy requires more than simple savings—it requires strategic protection. Properly structured Takaful plans serve as a backbone for intergenerational wealth preservation, ensuring that assets are transferred efficiently and responsibly according to Shariah principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Beyond Basic Coverage</h2>
    <p>Many families rely on standard protection plans, but these often fail to address future obligations, succession complexities, and multi-generational continuity. Expanding coverage to include estate transfer mechanisms, liquidity provisions, and flexible nomination options ensures that your financial legacy is protected.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Estate Mapping:</strong> Identify key assets and potential gaps to structure coverage effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Hibah & Nomination:</strong> Shariah-compliant tools to ensure smooth transfer of wealth without legal complications.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity Planning:</strong> Ensure sufficient cash flow to cover obligations, taxes, or unforeseen events.</li>
      <li><strong>Periodic Review:</strong> Adapt coverage as assets grow or family circumstances change.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Strategically structured Takaful goes beyond protection—it is an instrument of financial stewardship. By integrating advanced Shariah-compliant solutions, families can maintain continuity, minimize disruption, and secure their legacy for generations.</p>
