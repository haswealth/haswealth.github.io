    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Building a financial legacy requires more than simple savings—it requires strategic protection. Properly structured Takaful plans serve as a backbone for intergenerational wealth preservation, ensuring that assets are transferred efficiently and responsibly according to Shariah principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Beyond Basic Coverage</h2>
    <p>Many families rely on standard protection plans, but these often fail to address future obligations, succession complexities, and multi-generational continuity. Expanding coverage to include estate transfer mechanisms and liquidity provisions ensures that your financial legacy remains intact during the probate process.</p>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>Key Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Estate Mapping:</strong> Identify key assets and potential gaps to structure coverage effectively across your entire portfolio.</li>
      <li><strong>Hibah & Nomination:</strong> Utilizing Hibah as a tool to provide immediate liquidity to loved ones, bypassing the often lengthy Faraid distribution process.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity Planning:</strong> Ensuring sufficient cash is available to cover estate settlement costs, debts, or taxes without liquidating family assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Periodic Review:</strong> Adapting your legacy structure as your net worth grows or as your family tree evolves.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Role of Stewardship</h2>
    <p>Strategically structured Takaful goes beyond protection—it is an instrument of financial stewardship. By integrating advanced Shariah-compliant solutions, families can maintain continuity, minimize disruption, and secure their legacy for generations to come.</p>
