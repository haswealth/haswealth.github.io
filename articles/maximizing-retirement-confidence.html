    <p><em>Structured guidance to achieve peace of mind and financial independence during your later years.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction: The Psychology of Security</h2>
    <p>Retirement confidence is not derived from a single number in a bank account; it comes from having a resilient framework that balances consistent income, risk mitigation, and strict Shariah compliance. This multidimensional approach ensures that retirees can maintain their lifestyle standards while enjoying the <strong>Sakinah</strong> (tranquility) that comes from ethical financial stewardship.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The HAS Wealth Retirement Framework</h2>
    <p>Confidence is built on three essential pillars. When these are aligned, the "noise" of market volatility becomes secondary to the strength of the plan:</p>
    
    

    <ul style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Cash Flow Certainty:</strong> Designing a "synthetic salary" using Shariah-compliant dividend funds and sukuk yields to cover essential and lifestyle costs.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Contingency Protection:</strong> Using Takaful to ring-fence your retirement fund against the high costs of critical illness or long-term care.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Legacy Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that wealth transfer tools like <strong>Hibah</strong> are in place so your legacy is passed on without legal friction or delays.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Integration: The Power of 'Protection + Growth'</h2>
    <p>A fragmented plan is a fragile plan. By combining structured withdrawals from Shariah Unit Trusts with robust Takaful protection, we create a retirement ecosystem. This integration ensures that unforeseen medical events do not force you to sell your investments at the wrong time, preserving your capital for the long term.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dynamic Monitoring: Staying on Track</h2>
    <p>The world changes, and so should your plan. Regular portfolio reviews and rebalancing are essential to maintain alignment with your evolving lifestyle needs and the shifting Shariah landscape. This proactive monitoring is what separates a "hope-based" retirement from a "confidence-based" one.</p>
