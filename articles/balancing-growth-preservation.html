    <h2>The Investor's Dilemma</h2>
    <p>Investing in Shariah-compliant Unit Trusts requires a careful balance between growth and preservation. While capital growth is essential for beating inflation, disciplined risk management ensures the long-term sustainability of wealth. For Muslim families, this balance is about finding <strong>Barakah</strong> in steady, ethical progress rather than speculative gains.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Asset Allocation: The Foundation of Stability</h2>
    <p>Diversification is the only "free lunch" in investing. By allocating wealth across various Shariah-compliant asset classes—such as Sukuk (Islamic bonds), Equities, and Cash—you can mitigate potential losses while capturing growth. A structured, diversified portfolio offers stability without compromising Shariah standards.</p>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>Navigating Market Volatility</h2>
    <p>Market volatility is a natural part of the economic cycle. Shariah-compliant strategies often focus on "real" economy businesses, avoiding highly leveraged or speculative sectors. Regular monitoring and periodic rebalancing ensure that growth objectives are pursued without exposing your principal to undue risk.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Role of Periodic Review</h2>
    <p>Long-term growth relies on patience and consistent contributions (Dollar-Cost Averaging). However, as you approach specific life goals, your portfolio must shift toward preservation. This "glide path" approach ensures that your wealth is ready when you need it most, whether for retirement or family legacy.</p>
