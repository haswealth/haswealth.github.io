    <h1>Retirement Risk Management: Protecting Against Inflation, Longevity, and Market Volatility</h1>
    <p><em>Comprehensive Shariah-compliant strategies to safeguard retirement funds against key financial risks.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Retirement introduces a shift in risk priority. While accumulation was about growth, retirement is about resilience. We must defend against the "Three Silent Threats": inflation eroding purchasing power, longevity extending financial needs, and market volatility affecting distributions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Inflation: The Purchasing Power Risk</h2>
    <p>In Malaysia, the cost of healthcare and basic goods historically rises over time. Shariah-compliant Unit Trusts—specifically those with exposure to Shariah Equities and Global Sukuk—help your capital outpace inflation, ensuring your RM1 today maintains its value 20 years from now.</p>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>2. Longevity: The Risk of Outliving Your Wealth</h2>
    <p>As life expectancy increases, the "Decumulation" phase may last 30 years or more. A structured withdrawal plan, integrated with <strong>Takaful</strong> solutions for critical illness or long-term care, ensures that your financial resources are managed as a lifetime endowment rather than a shrinking pool of cash.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Market Volatility: Sequence of Returns</h2>
    <p>Market swings are inevitable, but their timing matters most in retirement. By employing <strong>Asset Allocation</strong> and maintaining a "Cash Buffer" (Money Market funds), we ensure you aren't forced to sell investments during a market downturn, allowing your portfolio time to recover.</p>

    <h3>Is your retirement plan risk-proof?</h3>
    <p>A "set-it-and-forget-it" approach can be dangerous in retirement. Let's perform a stress test on your current retirement strategy to ensure it can withstand these key risks.</p>
