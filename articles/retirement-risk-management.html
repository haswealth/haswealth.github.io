  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Retirement introduces multiple risks: inflation eroding purchasing power, longevity extending financial needs, and market volatility affecting investments. Shariah-compliant strategies provide a structured framework to mitigate these risks while preserving ethical compliance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Inflation Protection</h2>
    <p>Shariah-compliant investment instruments with growth potential help maintain purchasing power over time. Balanced portfolios, dividend-yielding funds, and strategic asset allocation reduce the impact of rising costs during retirement.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Longevity Planning</h2>
    <p>People are living longer, which extends the retirement period. Structured withdrawals, annuity-like Takaful solutions, and diversified income sources ensure financial sustainability, allowing retirees to maintain lifestyle without outliving assets.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Market Volatility Management</h2>
    <p>Periodic portfolio reviews, diversification, and rebalancing help mitigate exposure to market swings. Shariah-compliant principles guide investment selection to reduce speculative risks while preserving capital and growth potential.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Effective retirement risk management ensures long-term financial stability and confidence. <a href="../contact.html">Contact HAS Wealth Advisory</a> for tailored Shariah-compliant strategies that protect against inflation, longevity, and market volatility.</p>
