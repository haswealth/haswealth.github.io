      <h3 style="color: #64748b; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 25px;">Appointed Islamic Financial Adviser Representative (IFAR)</h3>
      
      <p>My practice is built on a singular principle: wealth is a trust (Amanah) that demands disciplined, long-term stewardship. My foundation in financial services began in 2013, focusing strictly on Takaful risk management. As my clients' wealth grew, it became clear that true financial stewardship requires a multi-dimensional strategy, leading me to expand into Shariah-compliant investment portfolios in 2017.</p>
      
      <p>Observing the inherent limitations of the traditional, single-provider sales industry, I made a decisive pivot to better serve my clients. In 2021, I officially transitioned to an Islamic Financial Adviser Representative (IFAR). This elevation allowed me to transcend tied-agency constraints and adopt a purely advisory-led, open-architecture framework. Today, my practice operates with an unwavering commitment to my clients' best interests, dedicated entirely to helping Muslim families and business owners structure, preserve, and grow their wealth in absolute alignment with Shariah principles.</p>
      
      <p>My vision for HAS Wealth Advisory is to build an institutional-grade firm managing RM100 Million in assets. This ambitious target is not just a metric of growth; it is a commitment to longevity. It guarantees to my clients that I am building a practice designed to be here to serve their family's wealth continuity for generations to come.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond the spreadsheets and portfolios, my approach to wealth management is deeply rooted in discipline and family. Whether I am cultivating the garden at my home, mastering complex Indian curries, traditional Malay dishes, and exploring Chinese cuisine for family dinners, or training in recurve archery with my eight-year-old son as we chase an Olympic dream, I understand that the best legacies require time, precision, and a structured plan to hit the mark.</p>
