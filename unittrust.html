  <h2>Our Investment Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Successful investing is not about "timing the market," but rather "time in the market." At HAS Wealth Advisory, we move away from speculative performance-chasing. Instead, we focus on <strong>Asset Allocation</strong>—helping you spread your wealth across different Shariah-compliant asset classes to manage risk while pursuing sustainable growth.</p>
